# My simple dotfiles

## Bash

I use a simple Bash configuration, if you like a pure but pretty Terminal, here you go!

## VIM

In a nutshell, I use Neovim, with vim-plug for managing plugins and with some custom configs for myself.

All VIM plugins are supported by most Linux Operational Systems and MacOS.

## Installation

### Arch Linux installation

Above I have two scripts the make installations for the both operational systems of my use. Mostly you'll need to change the package manager in case of using a different Linux distribution. Have fun!

Enter in the dotfiles folder and type:

```
$ sh installation/archlinux.sh
```

### Mac installation

Enter in the dotfiles folder and type:

```
$ sh installation/mac.sh
```
